COMPLEXITIES : In worst case, considering your parsed tree is a skewed tree, then, 
               both time and space complexities whether it is implemented recursively or iteratively is O(n).

               In an average case however, if you are considering a balanced/close-to-balanced tree, 
               the time complexity is always O(n) as you HAVE to visit each node where as space complexity changes to O(log n).
